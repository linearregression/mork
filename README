Mork provides automatic C bindings for Lua using ctypesgen-json and
alien. (Mork is a friendly alien. However, it cannot drink through its
fingers. Indeed, it does not have fingers. It is a shallow analogy.)
Mork is distributed under the MIT License, like Lua itself.

alien is a libffi binding for Lua: http://alien.luaforge.net/

ctypesgen-json turns C headers into JSON for use with libffi:
https://github.com/rrthomas/ctypesgen-json


Usage
-----

$ ctypesgen.py --all-headers --builtin-symbols --output-language=json /usr/include/foo.h -o foo.json

In Lua:

require "mork"
require "json"

module = mork.mork (json.decode (io.open ("foo.json"):read ("*a")))
